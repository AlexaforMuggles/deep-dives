# Welcome to Code Deep Dives

In code deep dives we look existing Alexa code and explain line for line what is happening and why. This is a good way to consolidate and repeat what I learned from reading docs and blog posts. It can also serve as a look-up later if I need to code a particular feature but am not sure anymore how that is supposed to be done.
